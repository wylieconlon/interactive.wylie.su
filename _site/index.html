	<h2 id='paint_mail'>Paint mail</h2>

<p>Using the technique I discovered earlier, I made a letter to send to my partner.</p>

<p><img src='/images/mail-3-1.jpg' alt='Mail' /> <img src='/images/mail-3-2.jpg' alt='Mail' /></p>

<p>As it goes through the postal system, this piece will be pressed in unknown ways, which will create an interesting final piece.</p>

<p>I set aside a couple hours to play with the fluid dynamics of paint, inspired by <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikecina/'>Mike Cina</a>&#8217;s similar experiments, particularly those with the marbling technique.</p>

<p><img src='/images/medium-1-1.jpg' alt='Invent a medium' /></p>

<p>First I diluted some water-soluble block printing ink and poured it into a pan.</p>

<p><img src='/images/medium-1-2.jpg' alt='Invent a medium' /></p>

<p>Putting paper directly into the water was unsuccessful, so I drained it and found that all the pigment had sunk.</p>

<p>A print using this method.</p>

<p><img src='/images/medium-1-4.jpg' alt='Invent a medium' /></p>

<p>After several variations of the above technique, using other fluids like salt water and detergent, I decided to apply paint directly to the paper.</p>

<p><img src='/images/medium-1-5.jpg' alt='Invent a medium' /></p>

<p>I liked the effect so much that I tried it a few other ways, and settled on a plastic sheet as the best way to handle the paint.</p>

<p>By pressing paint between two sheets of plastic, I can directly manipulate the pigments in whatever direction I want. This leads to interesting patterns and colors, especially when light shines through the plastic from underneath.</p>

	<h2 id='first_received_mail'>First received mail</h2>

<p>I received my partner Austin&#8217;s letter late, and opened it up. This is what I found:</p>

<p><img src='/images/mail-received-1-1.jpg' alt='Mail received' /> <img src='/images/mail-received-1-2.jpg' alt='Mail received' /></p>

<p>So I followed the directions:</p>

<p><img src='/images/mail-received-1-3.jpg' alt='Mail received' /> <img src='/images/mail-received-1-4.jpg' alt='Mail received' /></p>

	<h2 id='kinect_instrument'>Kinect instrument</h2>

<p>Using the Kinect 3D camera sensor and an image processing library, we set out to create a harp-like instrument using hand gestures for input.</p>

<p>We set up the instrument in Ryder hall between classes, where people were constantly walking by. Most ignored us, but we got a few successful interactions.</p>

<p>Technical difficulties plagued the project, but despite the problems it succeeded.</p>

<p><img src='/images/instrument-1.jpg' alt='Kinect instrument' /> <img src='/images/instrument-2.jpg' alt='Kinect instrument' /></p>

<p>We used signage to explain how to interact with the Kinect because most people did not understand what to do, in dual languages because we were on the language-learning floor.</p>

	<h2 id='wooden_letter'>Wooden letter</h2>

<p>I wanted to send an unusual object in the mail. I carved the address into a letter-shaped piece of balsa wood, put a couple stamps on, and dropped it in a mailbox.</p>

<p>It never arrived.</p>

<p><img src='/images/mail-1-1.jpg' alt='Wooden letter' /> <img src='/images/mail-1-2.jpg' alt='Wooden letter' /> <img src='/images/mail-1-3.jpg' alt='Wooden letter' /></p>
