<p>I set aside a couple hours to play with the fluid dynamics of paint, inspired by <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikecina/'>Mike Cina</a>&#8217;s similar experiments, particularly those with the marbling technique.</p>

<p><img src='/images/medium-1-1.jpg' alt='Invent a medium' /></p>

<p>First I diluted some water-soluble block printing ink and poured it into a pan.</p>

<p>Putting paper directly into the water was unsuccessful, so I drained it and found that all the pigment had sunk.</p>

<p>After several variations of the above technique, using other fluids like salt water and detergent, I decided to apply paint directly to the paper.</p>

<p>I liked the effect so much that I tried it a few other ways, and settled on a plastic sheet as the best way to handle the paint.</p>

<p>By pressing paint between two sheets of plastic, I can directly manipulate the pigments in whatever direction I want. This leads to interesting patterns and colors, especially when light shines through the plastic from underneath.</p>
