Using the Kinect 3D camera sensor and an image processing library, we set out to create a harp-like instrument using hand gestures for input.

We set up the instrument in Ryder hall between classes, where people were constantly walking by. Most ignored us, but we got a few successful interactions.

Technical difficulties plagued the project, but despite the problems it succeeded.

We used signage to explain how to interact with the Kinect because most people did not understand what to do, in dual languages because we were on the language-learning floor.
