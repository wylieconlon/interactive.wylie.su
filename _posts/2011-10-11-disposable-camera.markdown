I have this unusual fascination with disposable cameras. It's such an unreliable medium, with terrible optics, no focus, grainy film and bad lighting. But I love it for the spontaneity. I can hand a disposable camera to anybody, and they'll know what to do with it.

With that in mind, I decided to see what would happen if I sent a fresh disposable camera through the mail. Only once the pictures are developed will I know if it was successful.
