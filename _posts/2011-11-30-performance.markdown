I mediated an interaction with my classmate by putting a box on his head.

The box deprives the wearer of sight, and to show how that affected other senses I asked my classmate to do certain tasks:

- Touching his nose
- Jumping jacks
- Shaking my hand
- Sitting down in the middle of the class

These were surprisingly easy for him, perhaps because his other senses were reliable enough without sight.
