To fit the theme this week, I ended up reading through many, many pages of the postal regulations. They go into such detail about the kinds of live animals they can and can't ship, and specifically ban fruits and vegetables. So the inspiration for this one was trying to find food that I could send.

> Bees are acceptable in the continental surface mail when shipped under federal and state regulations to ensure that they are free of disease. Packages of honeybees must bear special handling postage, except those sent at a First-Class Mail price. Only queen honeybees may be shipped via air transportation. Each queen honeybee shipped via air transportation may be accompanied by up to eight attendant honeybees.
