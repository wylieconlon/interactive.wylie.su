To take my medium interactive, I decided to scale up. Instead of pushing paint around with my fingers, I let a crowd of people leave their marks.

I set up the piece in a well-traveled pathway between classes.

After leaving the piece for a while, I took it down and photographed the results.

Here they are, as a record of a crowd's movements:
