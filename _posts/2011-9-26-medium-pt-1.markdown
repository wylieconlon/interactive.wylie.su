Invent a medium pt. 1
---

I set aside a couple hours to play with the fluid dynamics of paint, inspired by [Mike Cina](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikecina/)'s similar experiments, particularly those with the marbling technique.

First I diluted some water-soluble block printing ink and poured it into a pan.

Putting paper directly into the water was unsuccessful, so I drained it and found that all the pigment had sunk.

After several variations of the above technique, using other fluids like salt water and detergent, I decided to apply paint directly to the paper.

I liked the effect so much that I tried it a few other ways, and settled on a plastic sheet as the best way to handle the paint.

By pressing paint between two sheets of plastic, I can directly manipulate the pigments in whatever direction I want. This leads to interesting patterns and colors, especially when light shines through the plastic from underneath.
