The email system is much less physical than the mail system, but it still has its quirks. One of them is how each email provider handles spam and security.

I tried to send an infinitely-recursive zip file to my partner through Gmail, but it rejected my request.

So instead I sent it through my personal account, which does no such filtering.

Due to Google's spam filtering, I'm half expecting this email to end up in the spam folder.
